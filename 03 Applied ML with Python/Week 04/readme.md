# Fourth week
Supervisied ML, part II

Due to several technical limitations of coursera platform, I can't either download train.csv, or make categorical features preprocessing, therefore I used only numerical features to make model. Nevertheless, even with numerical features using hyperparameters tuning with GridSearchCV it is possible to build a model with ROC AUC score high enough to 100% grade.

This week assignment will be modified as soon as train.csv will be available for download.
