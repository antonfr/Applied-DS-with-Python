# Fourth week
Supervisied ML, part II

Due to several technical limitations of coursera platform, I can't either download train.csv, or make categorical features preprocessing, therefore I used only numerical features to make model. Nevertheless, even with numerical features using hyperparameters tuning with GridSearchCV it is possible to build a model with ROC AUC score high enough to 100% grade.

Now this works fine, so this week assignment will be modified in the nearest future.
